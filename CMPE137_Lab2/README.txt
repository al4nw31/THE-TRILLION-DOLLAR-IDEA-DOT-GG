Build: To build this project I first had to make sure my simulator was on “ Generic iOS Device”.  From there I had to Go to Product -> Archive. After Archiving the project I had to Export the project as “Save for Development Deployment” as “Save for iOS Store Deployment” was not functioning.  This create the <file>.ipa. 

Description: I created this application using only code rather than creating the GUI with apples “Main.storyboard”.  My reasoning behind this was there are often many downsides to creating an application using the GUI tools.  I have experienced this first hand while using QT to create GUI’s for C++ applications.  There was much more flexibility for creating a calculator that was able to fit on all iPhone or iPad’s out of the box.  I also  felt that I had more immediate access to ending color and other attributes with the functions associated with editing the buttons.

I also included a video of me using the application that I created “CMPE137_Lab2.mov”.
